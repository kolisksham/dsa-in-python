# Python & DSA Daily Progress 🚀

Welcome! This repository tracks my daily journey as I learn **Python programming** and explore **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.
I'm doing a **heavy use of AI** to do so, even this file is written and beautified by AI after my prompt.

## 📅 About This Repo

- **Goal:** Document my day-to-day learning, practice problems, and progress in Python and DSA.
- **Audience:** Anyone curious about a beginner's path, wanting code examples, or seeking motivation for their own studies!

## 📝 How I Log My Progress

- **Daily Logs:** Each day, I create a file summarizing what I learned, practiced, and any challenges faced.
- Logs include:
  - New concepts or syntax learned.
  - Practice problems or topics from DSA.
  - Useful links, notes, or reflections.


## 🚧 Topics Covered

- Python Basics: variables, data types, functions, control flow.
- Data Structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues.
- Algorithms: searching, sorting, recursion, and more.
- Practice problems from sites like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
